//Challenge:
// Creating smart kitchen
// Will be composed of appliances

// addWater() will set coffeemaker's hasWorkTodo to true
// same with pourMilk and refridgerator
// Same with loadDishwasher()

// Or we could have a single setKitchenState method which takes three booleans

// We'll implement in two ways:

//First, access each appliance with getter and execue a method. orderFood(), doDishes or brewCoffee().
    // These check hasWorkTodo and if true, print message about what's being done

// Second, don't access appliance directly. Call doKitchenWork() which delegates work to any of its appliances.
